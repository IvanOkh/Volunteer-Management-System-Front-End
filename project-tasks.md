# Project Tasks

## Update:* Sunday, October 18, 2020

### APP-WIDE:

• Convert CARS pictures into light size images to be used throughout the app instead of unsplash pictures - Request has been denied by CARS. Keep unsplash feed.

### FORMS:

• Cat form responsive is still incomplete. Some input is extra small, and the "scroll to top" button disappeared.

### ADMIN-SIDE:

• Fix “Print Form” button to all submitted applications modals that are displayed to admin in “Applications” and “Adoptions” tabs.

• Apply responsive.

### USER-SIDE:

• Apply responsive.

### TASKS FOR THE NEW WEBSITE:

• Implement i-frames and convert them to custom css.

## Components Assignment

NOTE: For decorating and styling, please please please reuse classes already made in both the component's stylesheet and 'website-style.css'.
We want to try to make this thing as extensible, clean and organized as we can.

Remember: K.I.S.S. (Keep It Simple Stupid)

Albert you da best!
