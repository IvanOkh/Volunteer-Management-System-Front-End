            <p>
              Calgary Animal Rescue Society is made up of volunteers, some of us
              volunteer as foster parents, participate in adoption events, work
              at fundraisers, and are members of our Board of Directors. We all
              do our best to help animals in need find new fur-ever homes.
              Rescue is hard work. Often the days are long and the nights are
              even longer. We are very fortunate to have an amazing volunteer
              rescue team that work tirelessly and are available at a moments
              notice to help an animal in need. We are also a foster home based
              rescue, so our foster homes are critical and an important stepping
              stone in the rescue process. We can’t say enough good things about
              our fosters. They are there every time we need them. It’s all
              about team work!

            <p>
              Our primary goal is to find loving forever homes for cats and dogs
              in need, working with rescues throughout Alberta and across
              Canada. We have also formed partnerships with rescues in other
              countries to bring over dogs that may not otherwise have been able
              to find permanent homes. In addition to our rescue efforts, we
              occasionally will visit schools to educate, inform and answer
              questions to promote the importance of compassion.
