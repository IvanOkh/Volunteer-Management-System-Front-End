          <h3 class="text-red">Who we are</h3>
          <p>
            Calgary Animal Rescue Society is made up of volunteers, some of us
            volunteer as foster parents, participate in adoption events, work at
            fundraisers, and are members of our Board of Directors. We all do
            our best to help animals in need find new fur-ever homes.

          <h3 class="text-red">What we do</h3>
          <p>
            Our primary goal is to find loving forever homes for cats and dogs
            in need, working with rescues throughout Alberta and across Canada.
            We have also formed partnerships with rescues in other countries to
            bring over dogs that may not otherwise have been able to find
            permanent homes. In addition to our rescue efforts, we occasionally
            will visit schools to educate, inform and answer questions to
            promote the importance of compassion.

        Our network of volunteer foster homes is of paramount importance to
        Calgary Animal Rescue success. Animals are placed in appropriate foster
        homes where they receive necessary veterinary care, socialization with
        people and other animals, training, and most importantly – LOVE.
