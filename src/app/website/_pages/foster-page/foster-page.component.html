    <h2>Interested in Fostering?</h2>
    <h3>Why Should You Foster?</h3>
    <p>
      Our network of volunteer foster homes is of paramount importance to Calgary Animal Rescue success. Animals are placed in appropriate foster homes where they receive necessary veterinary care, socialization with people and other animals, training, and most importantly – LOVE . Our foster homes have the opportunity to discover each animal’s unique personality and help us to match the animal to the perfect forever home.
      <br>
      If you have love to spare, consider becoming a foster home. It is the most rewarding experience in life to know that you have given HOPE and LOVE to an animal in their hour of need.
