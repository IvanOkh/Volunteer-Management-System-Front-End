    <h3 class="text-red">Why Should You Foster?</h3>
    <p class="text-justify">
      Our network of volunteer foster homes is of paramount importance to
      Calgary Animal Rescue success. Animals are placed in appropriate foster
      homes where they receive necessary veterinary care, socialization with
      people and other animals, training, and most importantly – LOVE . Our
      foster homes have the opportunity to discover each animal’s unique
      personality and help us to match the animal to the perfect forever home.
      <br />
      If you have love to spare, consider becoming a foster home. It is the most
      rewarding experience in life to know that you have given HOPE and LOVE to
      an animal in their hour of need.
